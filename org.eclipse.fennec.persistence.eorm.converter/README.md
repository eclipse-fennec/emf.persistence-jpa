# Eclipse Fennec Persistence — CWM-EORM → Fennec EORM Converter

This bundle converts a **Common Warehouse EORM** model (Eclipse Daanse) into the equivalent
**Fennec Persistence EORM** model, so a warehouse-defined object/relational mapping can be consumed
by the Fennec persistence stack.

| | Model | nsURI | Artifact |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Source** | CWM-EORM | `https://www.daanse.org/spec/org.eclipse.daanse.cwm.model.cwmx.eorm` | `org.eclipse.daanse:org.eclipse.daanse.cwm.model.cwmx.eorm` |
| **Target** | Fennec EORM | `https://eclipse.org/fennec/persistence/eorm/1.0.0` | `org.eclipse.fennec.persistence.orm` |



## Intent

Both models are JPA-ORM descriptions expressed in Ecore, and they line up almost one-to-one by class
and feature name. The CWM-EORM, however, carries **more information** than the Fennec EORM needs.
The goal of the converter is to take a CWM-EORM instance (typically an `EntityMappings`) and return
the structurally equivalent Fennec EORM instance, **dropping the extra warehouse-only information**
that Fennec has no place for.

```java
EntityMappings fennec = new CwmToEormConverter().convertEntityMappings(cwmEntityMappings);
// or, for any root object:
EObject fennec = new CwmToEormConverter().convert(cwmRoot);
```

## How it works

The converter is built on EMF's [`EcoreUtil.Copier`][copier] — the same machinery used by `ECopier`
and `ORMCopier` in the EclipseLink bundle. `Copier` already provides a robust two-phase deep copy
(create + copy containments/attributes, then resolve cross-references), so the converter only
specialises the parts that differ between the two metamodels. See `CwmToEormConverter` /
`CwmToEormConverter.CwmEormCopier`.

### 1. Class & feature retargeting (the core of the mapping)

`Copier` copies *within* one metamodel by default. Two overrides turn it into a cross-metamodel copy:

- **`getTarget(EClass)`** — maps each CWM class onto the Fennec class with the **same name**
  (`EORMPackage.eINSTANCE.getEClassifier(name)`). Classes with no Fennec counterpart (e.g. Ecore
  helper types) are copied as-is.
- **`getTarget(EStructuralFeature)`** — resolves each feature **by name** on the retargeted Fennec
  class, returning `null` when no such feature exists.

A `null` feature is simply skipped, which is precisely how **CWM-only information is dropped** — no
explicit blocklist is needed. (EMF's `Copier` does *not* remap features across metamodels on its own;
its default returns the source feature unchanged. The existing `ECopier`/`ORMCopier` never needed
this override because they copy within a single metamodel.)

### 2. Enum remapping

`AccessType`, `FetchType`, etc. are generated as **distinct Java enums** in each model, so the raw
value cannot be `eSet` across them. `copyAttribute` is overridden to remap enum literals by name
(falling back to literal string) to the target `EEnum`.

### 3. Rebuilding the EMF binding (`accessibleObject`)

This is the one place the two metamodels diverge structurally, and the only hand-written mapping:

| Concept | CWM-EORM | Fennec EORM |
|---|---|---|
| feature binding | `feature : EStructuralFeature` directly on `ENamedBase` | wrapped in `EORMElement.accessibleObject` as an `EFeatureObject` |
| entity binding | `class : EClassifier` directly on `Entity` | `class` ref **plus** `accessibleObject` as an `EClassObject` |

The `class` reference copies straight across (same name on both sides). The CWM `feature` reference
has no Fennec counterpart, so the base copy drops it; a post-processing pass `rebuildAccessors()` then
reconstructs the Fennec `accessibleObject` (`EFeatureObject` / `EClassObject`), mirroring what
`EntityProcessor` and `MappingHelper.createNamedBase` do in the ORM bundle.

### References to the domain model

References that point at the user's domain Ecore (e.g. `Entity.class` → `EClass`,
`EFeatureObject.feature` → `EStructuralFeature`) are **preserved by identity**, not copied — they
must keep pointing at the same domain-model elements. This falls out of `Copier`'s
`useOriginalReferences` behaviour (references whose target is not itself being copied are kept as-is).

## What is intentionally lost

Any CWM-EORM class or feature without a same-named Fennec counterpart is silently dropped. This is
by design: the warehouse model is richer than the Fennec mapping model, and that extra detail is not
needed downstream.

## Dependencies

Only `org.eclipse.fennec.persistence.orm` (the Fennec EORM types) and EMF core. The converter does
**not** import any CWM-EORM Java type — it reads the source purely through its Ecore metamodel
(`eClass()` / `eGet`), so it works whether the source instance is backed by generated classes or a
dynamic package.

## Tests

`CwmToEormConverterTest` builds a small CWM-EORM `EntityMappings` bound to a throwaway domain Ecore,
converts it, and asserts the Fennec result: class-reference identity, `EClassObject` / `EFeatureObject`
rebuild, enum remapping (`AccessType`, `FetchType`), scalar copy, and that a CWM-only feature is
absent on the Fennec side.
